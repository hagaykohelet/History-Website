        <p>A natural phenomenon, known as camera obscura or pinhole image, can project a (reversed) image through a
            small
            opening onto an opposite surface. This principle may have been known and used in prehistoric times. The
            earliest
            known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in the 4th century BCE, in two different places in
            parallel: by Aristotle[6][7] in Greece and by Mozi in China.[8][7] Alhazen (or Ibn al-Haytham) is said to be
            the
            first that actually built a camera obscura. Until the 16th century the camera obscura was mainly used to
            study
            optics and astronomy, especially to safely watch solar eclipses without damaging the eyes. In the later half
            of
            the 16th century some technical improvements were developed: a biconvex lens in the opening (first described
            by
            Gerolamo Cardano in 1550) and a diaphragm restricting the aperture (Daniel Barbaro in 1568) gave a brighter
            and
            sharper image. In 1558 Giambattista della Porta was the first to write a description of using the camera
            obscura
            as a drawing aid[4] in his popular and influential books. Della Porta's proposal was widely adopted by
            artists
            and since the 17th century portable versions of the camera obscura were commonly used—first as a tent, later
            as
            boxes.

            The box type camera obscura was the basis for photographic cameras, as used in the earliest attempts to
            capture
            natural images in light sensitive materials. This was the first step in the path that Walter Benjamin
            described
            in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.[9]</p>
