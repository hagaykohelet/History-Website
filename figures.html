        <p>In 1851, English sculptor Frederick Scott Archer invented the collodion process.[49] Photographer and
            children's author Lewis Carroll used this process. Carroll refers to the process as "Talbotype" in the story
            "A Photographer's Day Out".[50]

            Herbert Bowyer Berkeley discovered that with his own addition of sulfite, to absorb the sulfur dioxide given
            off by the chemical dithionite in the developer, dithionite was not required in the developing process. In
            1881, he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, sulfite, and citric acid. Ammonia
            was added just before use to make the formula alkaline. The new formula was sold by the Platinotype Company
            in London as Sulphur-Pyrogallol Developer.[51]

            Nineteenth-century experimentation with photographic processes frequently became proprietary. The
            German-born, New Orleans photographer Theodore Lilienthal successfully sought legal redress in an 1881
            infringement case involving his "Lambert Process" in the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>
